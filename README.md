<h3>Digital Asset Processor</h3>

<p>
  Aerial7 is a web service that works in tandem with my Digital Asset Management demo.
  All systems like these need media processors to convert/resize digital assets.
  At the moment this one only calculates the dominant colour of an image to enable colour filters on my search pages.

<p>Below is a link to the frontend of this web service, which at the moment only shows a history job processed jobs</p>
